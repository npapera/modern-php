## Section 2 Notes

### In this section
- Learn the basics of PHP development:
    - Variables
    - Strings
    - How to include files
- Create a simple website for a restaurant

Important:
- PHP is just generating HTML
- The browser is just displaying the HTML code
- This means:
    - We pretty much just generate text with PHP
    - And the browser will just diplay it!

In this project:
- Develop a simple mult-page website
- See how PHP helps with this

- Parse error (webpage cannot be properly loaded unless this is resolved)
    - syntax error

    - failed to open stream
